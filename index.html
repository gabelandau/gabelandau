                <p>"Conspiracy Ipsum" is a spin-off of the typical "Lorem Ipsum" generator that is used for generating placeholder text in web-development and other related fields. Instead of generating the typical Latin text, this project will generate text taken from popular conspiracy theories and present it in a readable format.</p>
                <p>The program is being developed in JavaScript, using Angular to build a front-end interface with easy data-binding. Future updates include connecting a NoSQL database (MongoDB), an Express API, etc.</p>

                <p>Using a barebones kit, teams build cars with line-scan cameras and program the car in whatever manner they choose to drive along a path, following a line painted on the ground. Cars are judged based on speed, and are disqualified if they de-rail.</p>
                <p>Our car was programmed in MatLab, using an PID controller as the primary means of controlling the car. Different MatLab features assisted with connecting to the motor, wheels, etc.</p>
